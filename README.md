One of the people in that thread suggested I post it to GitHub so that others could make pull requests. I am hard
at work on making v3 from scratch but am also happy to recieve pull requests on this one. Anyone who wants to clone it for
their own purposes is also more than welcome to do so. 

Credits: 
  In addition to myself there have been two other major contributors to this little project:
  - Beroset: Heavily refactored the code in a pull request.
  - Reindeeren: Offered suggestions during a code review on Stack Exchange that helped immensely, and also
   suggested I put it on GitHub in the first place.
