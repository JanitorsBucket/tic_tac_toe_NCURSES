One of the people in that thread suggested I post it to GitHub so that others could make pull requests. I am hard
at work on making v3 from scratch but am also happy to recieve pull requests on this one. Anyone who wants to clone it for
their own purposes is also more than welcome to do so. 

Credits: 
  In addition to myself there have been two other major contributors to this little project:
  - Beroset: Heavily refactored the code in a pull request.
  - Reindeeren: Offered suggestions during a code review on Stack Exchange that helped immensely, and also
   suggested I put it on GitHub in the first place.

NOTE: This was something I did while I was in the process of learning C (or, I should say, EARLIER in the process of learning C).
It was to practice scripting game logic in pure C, and to practice using the ncurses API. It also gave me something to do
during a pretty rough time in my life. Over the period of a few weeks I built this, put it on Stack Exchange, got a lot of
feedback which I implemented, got some pull requests I accepted, and this is the result. My original program did not look this 
good as code before the refactors but it did behave basically the same way. The link to the Stack Exchange code review thread 
and some individual credits can be found above and I encourage all aspiring coders to take advantage of resources like that.
They have helped me a lot.
